Sandbox
=======

A prototype for sandboxing ruby stuff on Linux, with cgroups and Apparmor.

The box
-------

 * All the library are bundled
 * Apparmor bans network, removes capabilities
 * The disk is almost hidden, just ruby tool and code can be read.
 * The UNIX socket is the only thing writable, the only way to communicate.
 * Cgroup constrains CPU and RAM usage
 * Eye supervizes the service

Install and test it
-------------------

The ruby code is neutral, but the security wrapping is specific for Ubuntu Trusty.

    cd box
    make deps
    make install
    make apparmor

Add the box user

    make user

Create cgroup settings. The settings is 25% CPU share, 32Mo of RAM.

    make cgroup

Run the server

    make init.d
    sudo service sandbox start

You can now use the tiny client

    cat toto.haml | ./cli.rb /run/box/box.sock

Real world
----------

There is no limit in paranoia.

Restart the daemon periodicaly.

Install `tcpspy` and `auditd`, export syslog to a distant server.

Isolate the sandbox with virtualization, KVM or Xen, try grsec patch.

Auditing apparmor rules
-----------------------

    sudo apparmor_parser -Q --debug /etc/apparmor.d/opt.box.box

Only two writable things, /run/box and /run/box/box.sock
